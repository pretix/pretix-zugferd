"Note: Use this plugin at your own risk. If there is a semantic difference "
"between the XML and PDF contents in your ZUGFeRD invoices, you might legally "
"owe the VAT to the financial authorities twice, since you then legally sent "
"two invoices. We tried our best to avoid this, but we do not assume any "
"liability. Please check the output of this plugin with your tax or legal "
"attorney before use."
